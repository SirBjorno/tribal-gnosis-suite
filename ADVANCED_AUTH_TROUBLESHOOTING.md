# 🔍 Advanced Authentication Troubleshooting Plan

## 🚨 Current Status: Login Still Failing After Seeding

**Issue**: Authentication continues to fail with 401 Unauthorized even after running `npm run seed`

## 🔧 **Advanced Debugging Steps**

### **Step 1: Verify Seed Output**
When you ran `npm run seed`, what was the exact output? We need to confirm:
- ✅ "Connected to MongoDB successfully" 
- ✅ "Master user created successfully" OR "Master user already exists"
- ✅ "Seed completed successfully"

**If you didn't see these messages, the seeding failed.**

### **Step 2: Check for Multiple Issues**

#### **Possible Issue A: Account Lockout**
The security system locks accounts after 5 failed attempts for 30 minutes.
- **Solution**: Wait 30+ minutes before trying again
- **Alternative**: Restart backend service to reset in-memory lockout tracking

#### **Possible Issue B: Database User vs Seeded User Mismatch** 
The existing user might have different credentials than what we're seeding.
- **Evidence**: Tenant shows `currentUsers: 1` but our credentials don't work

#### **Possible Issue C: Password Hash Algorithm Mismatch**
Different bcrypt rounds or hashing method.

### **Step 3: Advanced Solutions**

#### **Solution 1: Restart Backend Service** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
```bash
# In Render Dashboard -> Backend Service
# Click "Manual Deploy" -> "Deploy Latest Commit"
# This clears in-memory lockouts and ensures fresh environment
```

#### **Solution 2: Create Temporary Diagnostic Endpoint**
Add a temporary endpoint to check user existence:

```typescript
// Add to backend temporarily for debugging
app.get('/api/debug/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const users = await User.find({}).select('email role tenantId active');
    res.json({ users, count: users.length });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

#### **Solution 3: Force Re-seed with Database Reset**
```bash
# In backend shell:
node -e "
const { User } = require('./dist/models');
const { connectDB } = require('./dist/config/database');
connectDB().then(() => {
  User.deleteMany({ email: 'bjorn.bovim@gmail.com' }).then(() => {
    console.log('User deleted, now re-run seed');
  });
});
"
npm run seed
```

## 🚀 **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Option 1: Service Restart** (Fastest)
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Backend Service -> Settings -> Manual Deploy
3. Click "Deploy Latest Commit"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
5. Try login again

### **Option 2: Extended Lockout Wait**
1. Wait 45 minutes (to ensure any lockouts expire)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try login in incognito/private browser
4. Use exact credentials: `bjorn.bovim@gmail.com` / `TribalGnosis2025!`

### **Option 3: Database Direct Check**
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Browse Collections -> Users collection
3. Check if user with email `bjorn.bovim@gmail.com` exists
4. Verify the password hash format

## 🔍 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

**Successful Login Response:**
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "name": "Master Admin", 
  "email": "bjorn.bovim@gmail.com",
  "role": "master",
  "tenantId": "...",
  "active": true,
  "token": "jwt-token-here",
  "tenant": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Tribal Gnosis Master",
    "companyCode": "TRIBAL-MASTER-2025"
  }
}
```

## 🚨 **Most Likely Solution**

**The issue is probably account lockout from testing.** 

**Quick Fix**: Restart the backend service in Render dashboard - this will:
1. ✅ Clear in-memory account lockouts
2. ✅ Reset rate limiting counters  
3. ✅ Refresh all security middleware
4. ✅ Ensure environment variables are loaded fresh

Try this first - it should resolve the issue immediately.
